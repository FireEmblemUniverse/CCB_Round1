## Ch7MoneyVillage
[Left][Load][0x5F][0x01]
[Right][LoadCurrent]
I am sick and tired of donating to Hex.[N]
Instead, I'll donate this money to you.[A][X]

## Ch7SwordVillage
[Left][LoadSoldier]
[Right][LoadCurrent]
Over at the port's gate is a Donateenary[N]
general named Murray. He's an absolute[AN]
monster and he just extorts every penny[N]
out of us. Use this sword to slay him![A][X]

## RecruitingRoshea
[Left][LoadRoshe]
[Right][LoadCurrent]
My name is Roshea and this[N]
text is a placeholder.[A][X]

## RecruitingBob
[Left][Load][0x24][0x01]
Bob the thief, can he steal it?[N]
Bob the thief, yes he can![AN]
(This text is a placeholder, by[N]
the way. Just so you know.)[A][X]

## RecruitingCelicia
[Left][LoadCelicia]
"You are the ocean's gray waves..."[N]
Lost in Thoughts All Alone, the anthem[AN]
of Nolore. They seem to play it all[N]
the time, but it's quite soothing some-[AN]
[Right][LoadCurrent]
Um, excuse me?[A]
[Left]
Oh! I'm sorry, I didn't see you there.[N]
My name is Celicia. I'm a wandering[AN]
mage, exploring this desert. Are you[N]
here fighting these bandits in the fog?[AN]
Don't worry. My horse is not slowed down[N]
by the desert sands, so I won't be left[AN]
behind. My magic is quite powerful, so[N]
these bandits shouldn't last very long.[AN]
[Right]
Is it just me, or do you look like-[A]
[Left]
Princess Anteze of Sofia? Yeah, I hear[N]
that a lot. Why does it matter, anyway?[A][X]

## EevsterSpawns
[MidLeft][LoadEevster]
CARLYLE! You will pay for stealing[N]
the Basement throne from me! Get down[AN]
here and fight me, one on one! Men,[N]
don't let any of the traitors live![AN][X]

## RecruitingRogueAnna
[Left][LoadRogueAnna]
Ooh, a lava cave. And a ruined[N]
fortress to boot! This place is[AN]
gonna be filled to the brim with[N]
treasure! And once I'm done, I[AN]
might just set a secret shop up[N]
here. Dead Valley Lava Cavern...[AN]
The thought is making me giddy![N]
But why in the world is Void here?[AN][X]

## Ch22AfterPrep
[Left][LoadCelica]
I'll write a more proper opening[N]
later. PLACEHOLDER[A][X]

## Ch22Summoning
[Left][LoadCelica]
Arise, creatures of the depths...[N]
Come now, and devour my enemies![AN]
MESSIAH![A][X]

## Ch23Hammerne
[Left][Load][0x40][0x01]
*rattle rattle*[N]
Oh, hello there. Not too often[AN]
you see humans drop in these parts.[N]
Especially with the zombies and[AN]
skeletons fighting again. *sigh*[N]
Us skeletons use Hammerne staves[AN]
a lot when our bones break, which[N]
is a frequent occurence. Maybe they[AN]
work on a human's bones as well![N]
Take this one and see how it works.[AN][X]

## Ch23DoowileAppears
[OpenLeft][LoadDoowile]
*moan*[N]
Awright, those darned skellies[N]
have gotten away with this fer[AN]
long enough! Fellow zombies,[N]
take down the skeletons! Ol'[AN]
Bones? Sher, his days are numbered.[N]
We'll restore our zombie colony![AN][X]

## RecruitingDoowileVoid
[Left][LoadDoowile]
[Right][LoadVoid]
These skeletons are causing a great[N]
deal of hassle for my army. Are you-[AN]
[Left]
Yer gonna deal with the skeletons?[N]
Well if yer gonna bump off Bones,[AN]
then count me in with yer army o'[N]
humans! I'm the clean sort, ya know.[AN][X]

## RecruitingDoowileKaga
[Left][LoadDoowile]
[Right][LoadKaga]
Ah, Doowile. It's been a long time.[N]
I see you're a zombie now. How did[AN]
that happen? Some plagues happen when[N]
I was gone, or did you get cursed?[AN]
[Left]
'Twas Maeda, I tell ya. That darn[N]
Maeda. One day yer mindin' your[AN]
own business trying to keep the[N]
place in a decent state, and all[AN]
of a sudden you get zapped by some[N]
witch or another, Thorp I think,[AN]
and my flesh clean vanished. Dang.[AN]
[Right]
Don't worry. Maeda's been taken[N]
of, so you could join me now.[A]
[Left]
I suppose that's a decent plan. But[N]
we gotta take care of Bones first![A][X]

## RecruitingBjorn
[OpenRight][LoadVoid]
[OpenLeft][LoadBjorn]
Bonjour, madame. Ca va?[A]
[Right]
Uh, excuse me? I don't understand[N]
a single word you're saying.[A]
[Left]
Ah, my name is Bjorn, and I happen[N]
to study as a linguist... That's[AN]
besides the point. In this shrine,[N]
the Donateenaries have one of their[AN]
strongest generals; Banana. If left[N]
unchecked, Banana will cause ruin.[AN]
I can't join you yet, but once Banana[N]
falls, that might change. Bonne chance,[AN]
Void. Take this elixir before you go.[AN][X]

## BjornSpawns
[Left][LoadBjorn]
The guardians are dead... I must now[N]
destroy Banana while she's weak.[AN]
If I fail, Donateenary troops will[N]
reinforce her and all will be lost...[A][X]

## Ch25EndingBjornAlive
[Left][LoadBjorn]
[Right][LoadVoid]
Ugh, I hate bananas. Who was that[N]
woman anyway, an evil Anna?[AN]
[Left]
I suppose you could say that...[N]
Anyway, the shrine is safe. We[AN]
no longer have to fear Banana's[N]
power, and the Donateenaries are[AN]
going to be in a panic. We must[N]
now press on, and I shall aid you[AN]
in your efforts. Merci, Void.[AN]
[Right]
What did you just say?[N]
...Oh, whatever.[AN][X]

## RecruitingMarth
[Left][LoadMarth]
[Right][LoadCurrent]
I can't really think of much to[N]
say right now, so this text is[AN]
a PLACEHOLDER. Don't call me[N]
Marthipan, though. Please?[AN]
