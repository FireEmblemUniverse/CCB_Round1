You're the commander of that[N]
other army out there, huh?[AN]
You're saying you wanna kill[N]
the Demon King or somethin'?[AN]
Well if you'll help my army[N]
get to the enemy HQ, I'll[AN]
join your quest. Oh, and be[N]
sure to check out the island[AN]
south of our position. Let's[N]
say I've got a friend there.[A][X]

##Ch15Start
[MidLeft][LoadFace][0x2][0x1]
Ugh, I can't see a thing.[N]
Even the weather is in my way![AN]
And there's a whole horde of[N]
soldiers storming our way![AN][X]

##Ch15StartContinued
[MidLeft][LoadFace][0x42][0x1]
I dunno what an airport is, but[N]
I have a massive army! Those rebels[AN]
on the other side of the straits[N]
are in my way! Army, move out![AN]
Take advantage of the fog, fliers![N]
Naval units... Fire the seige![AN][X]

##Ch15GetTorches
[MidLeft][LoadFace][0x2][0x1]
Oh, who left these lying around?[A][X]

##Ch15End
[MidLeft][LoadFace][0x2][0x1]
Whew. The might of the Orange[N]
Star Army is annoying. I hope[AN]
I don't have to deal with them[N]
being in the way... considering[AN]
the horrible weapons they're[N]
rumoured to have.[A][X]

##Ch15AmbushWarning
[MidLeft][LoadFace][0x2][0x1]
Ambush coming![A][X]

##Ch15VillageStuff
[MidLeft][LoadFace][0x60][0x1]
Are you with Anna's army?[N]
Please, take this, and drive[AN]
away those invaders from that[N]
Wars World place! Aptly named![AN][X]

##Ch15TopHouseText
[MidLeft][LoadFace][0x61][0x1]
The hell you doing here?[N]
Leave me be, and scram![AN][X]

##Ch15BottomHouseText
[MidLeft][LoadFace][0x62][0x1]
Over a few hundred miles away[N]
is a fierce battle. There's[AN]
a powerful company, Intelligent[N]
Systems, who control a thing[AN]
called "Fire Emblem". Now[N]
Fire Emblem was created by[AN]
a man named Kaga. However,[N]
Kaga's a bit nuts. Incest,[AN]
slave dancers, poor balance,[N]
the works. However, he was[AN]
recently ousted and exiled.[N]
Fire Emblem is now run by[AN]
a man named Maeda. Maeda...[N]
After the exile, things[AN]
weren't too bad. Elibe,[N]
Magvel, Tellius... Then[AN]
the return to Akaneia[N]
happened. Kris. Maeda.[AN]
Doom. Timeskip. Awakening.[N]
Timetravel. Waifus. Thorp.[AN]
Now things are getting[N]
worse! Corrin! Revelations![AN]
Extreme waifus! No lore![N]
Thankfully, an insider forced[AN]
Maeda away from Valencia[N]
and Fire Emblem's getting[AN]
better, but Maeda didn't[N]
take it well. He has cursed[AN]
Kaga into being a dancer.[N]
He says it was revenge for[AN]
the slave dancer girls...[N]
Please! Save Kaga![A][X]
